summary : today i learned how to clone the directory into local machine by git clone command .
we can do it in 2 ways by https or shh keys.but ssh key is better as we can directly clone it
after cloning we can make changes to the repository by using commands in our local machine .
we should add , commit and push the changed file to our repository
